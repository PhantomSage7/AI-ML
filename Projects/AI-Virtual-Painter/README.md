# Virtual-Painter
AI Virtual Paint is an application that allows users to virtually paint in the air using their fingers. The project is developed in Python utilizing OpenCV for image processing and drawing, as well as MediaPipe for hand tracking.

### Tech Stacks:
- OpenCV (for image processing and drawing)
- Mediapipe (for Hand Tracking)

## Prerequisites:
- Python version 3.7 or later is required.
- Install the necessary modules for the project using the following command:
```
pip install <module name>
```

## Features:
* Draw on the system screen based on the movement of your index finger.
* Real-time hand tracking.

### Working:
* This project showcases the application of Hand Tracking technology.
* When the user presents their hand to the camera, the application detects it and draws a bounding box around the hand.
* Drawing mode is activated when the user shows only the index finger.
* To select different colors or the eraser, the user can perform specific gestures, such as bringing both the index and middle fingers together at the top of the color icon.
