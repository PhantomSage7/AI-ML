# Projects Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of projects that I have completed to date. Each project is described in more detail below, along with the technologies and tools that I used to build it.

## Projects
### AI Virtual Painter
The AI Virtual Painter is a fun and interactive application that uses computer vision and hand tracking to allow users to paint with their hands. It was built using OpenCV for image processing and Mediapipe for hand tracking.

How to Run
To run the AI Virtual Painter, you will need to have Python and the following dependencies installed:
<br>
OpenCV
<br>
Mediapipe
<br>
Once you have these dependencies installed, you can run the application by executing the VirtualPainter.py script.

### Diabetes Prediction Model Web App
The Diabetes Prediction Model Web App is a web-based tool that allows users to input their data and receive a prediction of whether they are at risk of developing diabetes. It was built using requests, scikit-learn, ngrok, pickle, and Streamlit.

How to Run
To run the Diabetes Prediction Model Web App, you will need to have Python and the following dependencies installed:
<br>
requests
<br>
scikit-learn
<br>
ngrok
<br>
pickle
<br>
Streamlit
<br>
Once you have these dependencies installed, you can run the application by executing Deploying_ML_model_as_public_API_ngrok.ipynb.

### RSS Feed Aggregator
The RSS Feed Aggregator is a web-based application that allows users to aggregate and view content from multiple RSS feeds. It was built using Celery, natural language processing (NLP), SQLite, requests, Flask, and RSS.
<br>
How to Run
<br>
To run the RSS Feed Aggregator, you will need to have Python and the following dependencies installed:
<br>
Celery
<br>
NLP
<br>
SQLite
<br>
requests
<br>
Flask
<br>
RSS
<br>
Once you have these dependencies installed, you can run the application by executing the main.py script.

### Blog Generator LLM
The Blog Generator LLM is a web-based tool that allows users to input a prompt and generates a blog post based on that prompt. It was built using the Llama 2 language model, Hugging Face, and Flask.
<br>
How to Run
<br>
To run the Blog Generator LLM, you will need to have Python and the following dependencies installed:
<br>
Llama 2
<br>
Hugging Face
<br>
Flask
<br>
Once you have these dependencies installed, you can run the application by executing the app.py script.

#### Other Projects
I have also completed the following projects:

Housing Price Prediction: A machine learning model that predicts the price of a house based on various features.
Movie Recommendation System: A recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their past viewing history.
Linear Logistic Regression from Scratch: An implementation of linear logistic regression using NumPy and other basic Python libraries.
URL Shortener: A web-based tool that allows users to input a long URL and generates a shortened version of that URL.
